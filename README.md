# Urban Sound Classification

Tech Stack: Python, Librosa, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow and Keras

<li>Developed a deep learning model using Python and Keras to accurately classify urban sounds, achieving an accuracy of 75.72%.</li>
<li>Used the UrbanSound8K dataset, which contains over 8,732 sound samples from 10 different classes of urban sounds. Extracted features from the audio data using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) before feeding it into the model.</li>
<li>Built a dense neural network architecture with multiple layers of dense, activation, and dropout to learn the relevant features in the audio data.</li>
